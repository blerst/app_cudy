    /*
    The form of this div is where all the elements shown to the user are stored

    For the onChange variable, think of the 'e' as representing the event
    sort of like how you would view increments with 'i'
    When you use a button, the user input gets recorded as 'e' and can be saved using 'e'

    The todos.map allows for elements (like buttons) to be added. For example the remove todo feature
    
    The key inside the map div allows us to ensure that each identifier once on screen is unique.
    
    The onClick handle in the deleteButton allows for a function to execute on click.
    
    Checked is a bool value which will change the variable of a todo based on the checked status

    todoEditing === todo.id ? represents conditional rendering where whichever todo is being edited, it will display a box for input
    otherwise it will remain the same essentially it exist to choose which boxes the user needs to see
